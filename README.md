# -Alexander-Volkanovski-vs-Diego-Lopes-UFC-314-

Alexander Volkanovski: the seasoned crusader.
Former UFC featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski is on a mission to reclaim his title after a rocky stretch. At 36, he has steep hills to climb, with back-to-back knockout defeats at the hands of Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria. But Volkanovski remains confident about his chances despite these failures, noting his experience and tactical skill as potential advantages. He’s not just fighting for his own glory; he’s fighting for his family, too, including a new baby on the way — and to silence the doubters.
Volkanovski's plan is to utilize his footwork to avoid kamikaze-style advances and outlast Lopes throughout the fight. Lopes’ aggressive style is dangerous but Roberts believes it will contribute to his downfall should he become reckless in search of a finish.

Diego Lopes, 30, also climbed the featherweight ranks with a five-fight winning streak. His path to the title fight started with a suicide mission to face Movsar Evloev on short notice, which he lost, but it still showed his potential. Lopes is known primarily for his fearless standup and knockout power, but he has a strong grappling base as the owner of 12 submissions across his career as well.
If there is a motto Lopes lives by, it is to take opportunities and not be afraid of risks. He considers this battle to be the culmination of his struggles and hard work, and is it very sure of his ability to capitalize on Volkanovski's recent lapses. The Lopes plan will probably include keeping his bandana on and looking to sneak a punch with a lot of mustard on it early in the fight.
The Clash of Styles
This is a clash of styles — Volkanovski with his methodical approach, Lopes as a barnstorming puncher. The fight will be decided by if Volkanovski is able to weather Lopes' early barrage, and take advantage of a potential cardio problem from his opponent later on. By contrast, Lopes can win the king's crown by keeping up with his rhythm and landing a big hit and getting the KO.
For both fighters, the stakes are high as Volkanovski looks for redemption while Lopes attempts to secure his first championship in the Ultimate Fighting Championship. The event will serve as an entertaining showdown of generations and fighting philosophies.
